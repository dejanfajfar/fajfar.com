Using HTTPS again!

<!-- more -->

After a little struggle with our previous ssl certificate provider [starSSL](https://www.startssl.com/), which it seams
is not so _trusted_ anymore I had to find an alternative.

Eventually I came across [letsencrype](https://letsencrypt.org/) which provided me with a valid certificate that is 
valid for the next three months after which it will have to be renewed. 

More about the struggle and the now working solution in a later post. 

And just as out of personal satisfaction we now have a _A+_ rating on [SslLab](https://www.ssllabs.com)
