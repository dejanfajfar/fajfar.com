The simplest way to keep something in mind is with a countdown timer. 

A timer that relentlessly ticks of the seconds until _something_ happens. This is the sole premise behind this little
website that counts down to a mysterious event in the far future of 2018. 

And because some people expressed an desire to have their own countdown timers I will create a generalized variant and
share it with te world. 

For now this little __gem__ can be found at: [dle.fajfar.com](http://dle.fajfar.com)
