Last time I promised that there will be some video tutorials about regarding shell scripting.

Let's just say that things did not go as planed...

<!--More-->

It all started out great and I even prepared the WMs, as shown below.

But then something happened...There was a PSN sale and I finally bought a game that was long on my wishlist!

Yes I bought __No mans sky__. Because I spend countless hours in _minecraft_ still, I had high hopes for this one, and with the 
recent updates it sounded more and more like a game I would like to play.

After getting it I have been blown away by it, and ~30 hours in I still cant put it away.

And that is not all that has happened.

I have also __reinitialized__ two projects of mine:

* [Epoch.net](https://github.com/dejanfajfar/epoch.net)
* [openTSDB.net](https://github.com/dejanfajfar/openTSDB.net)

Both are being developed on my Mac inside [Jetbrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/?fromMenu) which is actually
turning out to be a quite competed IDE, a separate review will follow, in time.
 
## Conclusion

It is only fair to say that the shell school is put on ice for now. First i would like to get articles on those two 
projects done, then a little rider review and later down the line a no mans sky review. 

This does not mean that there will be no shell school. I will still work on the repository with the samples and scripts 
for the episodes. So if you would like to read and give feedback all can be found at [dejanfajfar/shell.101](https://github.com/dejanfajfar/shell.101)

Thank you for your patience.
