Learn __shell__ with me!

<!-- more -->

This is a little teaser for a shell tutorial series i am preparing.

I am still setting things up and trying to get better equipment for the recording part. But in general we will start
with the basics

* environment setup
* simple input/output
* Basic data processing
* Files

Currently I am quite busy and can hardly find time for _this_.

I sincerely hope that this will change in the next week.

Thank you all for sticking around
