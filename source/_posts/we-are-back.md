We are back and this time on our own virtual server and HEXO!

<!-- More -->

## Why hexo?

After spending some time figuring out how to make the new _site_ more dynamic than the old one I came to the collusion 
that the only way of doing this is to incorporate some kind of __CMS__ system.

This was something I wanted to avoid as much as possible. usually a CMS system is something that can do everything but
nothing really fast. But I know that in the last couple of years a new bread of CMS system has come out. A bread of
lightweight systems that put as little as possible between you and your page, but still deliver impressive support and
functionality.

Trying a few of them I have settled on Hexo because it just somehow resonated with me. Build with _nodeJs_ and requiring
nothing on the server, because it generates static files. It was just what I was looking for. 

All the internal workings of the __engine__ are there for all to see and experiment with. The pluggable system
architecture allows for limitless expansion without the initial fluff.

In other words:

> It makes simple things simple and complicated things possible

I have got this thing working and deployed the first version. There are still things missing that have to be done. 

But for today this is enough.
